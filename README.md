## Getting Spring Boot configured in a Codespace from scratch...

1. Created an empty repo and created a Codespace for it; I selected a Maven .gitignore.
1. I had already installed (somehow) the Spring Boot extensions in VS Code.  I assume this because amongst the "Get Started" tabs that popped up in VS Code was a *Get Started with Spring Boot in VS Code*.  I selected the "Create a new Spring Boot project."
1. I selected almost random settings, including most of the helper dependencies.
1. Attempted to Run as Java - had to switch to Standard Mode but it worked (returned JSON).
1. Went to test explorer - the one test succceeded.
1. Reviewed the [Spring Boot starter guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) and specifically added the HelloController.
1. Added the HelloControllerTest sample and ran the test... It passed!
1. Commited and pushed baseline code...

## Next?
